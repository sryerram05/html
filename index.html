    <h2>Rando Guy runs 9.11 second 100 meter</h2>
    <p>In the following article a man by the name of Bsain Uolt runs a incredible 9.11 second 100 meter. A few words that come from the man himself.</p>
    <p>"Hey guys, it me Bsian Uolt and yes I did run a 9.11 second 100 meter. Its not hard, if you go by my motto: <b>Eat Sleep Run</b>, there is no time to think"</p>
    <p>He claims to have set a record and did not know until a week later as he stormed out of the stadium after setting such record. </p>
    <p> A few of his quotes are as follow</p>
    <ol>
      <li>"If you need more time just sleep faster"</li>
      <li>"If you want to win, then don't lose"</li>
      <li>"Talent fails to work hard when hardwork has more talent"</li>
    </ol>
    <p>[Applause], Many people are deeply inspired by these inspirational quotes and have chosen to take upon themselves to create a statue of this hero. It is rumored that said man has a net worth of $-10,000,000,000,000. In fact he is in debt.</p>

    <h2>Scammer scams big. PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOU LIKE/BELIEVE IN THOR</h2>
    <p>This next article is huge, as a new scammer from Asgard just scammed Thor Ragarock his enitire hammer. Thor unfrotunalty can not get it back as it is locked in Askaban. The scam was unexpected as Thor received a call on his phone that his hammer has lost it's insurance and needed to be restored.</p>
    <p>Thor being a god realized that the only chance to make Odin happy was to have his hammer. Unfortunalty, he did not know about the scams that mere mortals do and fell for the trap like a mouse and cheese.</p>
    <p>His brother Loki, can not do anything as he can shape shift into anything as nobody can trust him. He unfortunatly is at the bottom of hirarchy. Odin is heavily dissapointed in Thor, as this is the first time that a god has been scammed by the mere mortals.</p>

  <h1>Audience Participation</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Of course, we don't want to keep our audience bored so we decided to keep a few games to keep them on their toes. The first one we like to call: Quick Smarts. Check answers after</p>
    <ol>
      <li>What shape has no sides?</li>
      <li>What is 6-9*2?</li>
      <li>What does a barometer measure?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you can answer all these questions then you are smarter than an elementry schooler</p>
    <p>The second game gives you a riddle and you must find a word that is associated with it</p>
    <p><b>You look at it everyday. You can see it a mile away. If you don't cut it then it's harder to handle</b></p>
    <p>And the last game we have is a classic Wordle from NYT, of course we won't play the game due to possible copyright claims. So to skip the hassle we just decided to paste the link for you to enjoy.</p>
